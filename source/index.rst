GTMP-LuaConnector documentation
=============================================

Description of all GT-MP API functions can be found on `GT-MP Wiki <https://wiki.gt-mp.net/>`_

In this documentation you can find descriptions about events, available objects, their properties and functions, and some code samples.

This library uses `MoonSharp <http://www.moonsharp.org/>`_ Lua interpreter. It's almost not `differs <http://www.moonsharp.org/moonluadifferences.html>`_ from classic lua but it has some `additional things <http://www.moonsharp.org/additions.html>`_.

.. note:: All API functions are accessible from ``API`` table (so you just write it like in C# scripts)
